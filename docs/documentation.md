## User Guide

### Understanding the Problem-Solving Framework

The app uses a systematic methodology based on professional troubleshooting practices:

1. **Problem Statement** - Define what's wrong with what object using professional format
2. **IS/IS NOT Analysis** - Document problem boundaries systematically
3. **Dimensional Analysis** - Investigate WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, EXTENT comprehensively
4. **Solution Development** - Generate solutions through structured analysis (optionally AI-enhanced)
5. **Validation** - Evaluate and refine solutions systematically

### Main Interface Overview

#### **Problem Specification Area**
The main scrollable area where you:
- Enter your problem statement in professional "Object/Defect" format
- Fill in WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, and EXTENT sections systematically
- Complete IS/IS NOT analysis for each dimension
- View suggested solutions (generated systematically or AI-enhanced)
- See diagnostic questions (to guide further investigation)

#### **Solve Panel**
The bottom action area containing:
- **Analyze Button** - Processes your systematic analysis (with optional AI enhancement)
- **Workflow Selector** - Choose between different processing modes
- **Examples Menu** - Access built-in problem examples demonstrating the methodology
- **Export/Import** - Share or save your structured problem documents

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### **1. Define Your Problem**
- Tap in the problem statement field
- Use the format: "What object has what defect"
- Example: "My car does not start on cold mornings"
- Be specific and focus on observable symptoms

#### **2. Complete the Analysis Sections**

**WHAT Section:**
- WHAT IS: List things that have the problem and what's wrong
- WHAT IS NOT: List similar things that don't have the problem

**WHERE Section:**
- WHERE IS: Location where problem occurs, position on the object
- WHERE IS NOT: Places where you'd expect to see the problem but don't

**WHEN Section:**
- WHEN IS: When problem first noticed, patterns in timing
- WHEN IS NOT: Times when problem could occur but doesn't

**EXTENT Section:**
- EXTENT IS: How many objects affected, severity, trends
- EXTENT IS NOT: How many could be affected but aren't

#### **3. Choose Your Processing Workflow**

The systematic analysis you've completed can be processed in different ways:

**Manual Analysis:**
- Review your structured IS/IS NOT analysis systematically
- Identify patterns and boundaries manually
- Develop solutions based on systematic findings
- Full control over the analytical process

**System Prompt Workflow:**
- Generates a formatted prompt for use with your own AI tools
- App copies structured analysis to clipboard for external processing
- Maintain full control over AI interaction
- No data sent to external services from the app

**Public AI Workflow:**
- AI enhancement of your systematic analysis
- Your structured data may be used to improve AI models
- Immediate additional perspectives within the app
- No additional cost

**Private AI Workflow (Premium):**
- AI enhancement with privacy guarantee  
- Your structured data is not used for training
- Requires subscription purchase
- Same immediate enhancement as Public AI

#### **4. Review Suggestions and Continue Analysis**

After processing (manual or AI-enhanced), you'll see:

**Suggested Solutions:**
- Potential solutions based on your systematic analysis
- Tap to navigate to detailed evaluation
- Accept, reject, or mark as "not sure" based on your assessment
- Accepted solutions appear in main view for further investigation

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- Follow-up questions for deeper systematic investigation  
- Answer questions to refine your understanding within the structured framework
- Questions help validate or eliminate potential causes systematically

#### **5. Evaluate and Refine Systematically**

**Solution Evaluation:**
- Review each suggested solution against your systematic analysis
- Consider feasibility, cost, and likelihood of success based on your IS/IS NOT findings
- Use Accept/Reject/Not Sure buttons to guide further investigation
- Focus on solutions that address root causes identified through structured analysis

**Answer Diagnostic Questions:**
- Navigate to diagnostic questions section
- Answer each question based on your systematic investigation
- Use the text editor to provide detailed responses within the structured framework
- Questions help eliminate false leads and confirm hypotheses systematically

### Using the App Without AI

The systematic methodology provides significant value even without AI enhancement:

#### **Manual Analysis Benefits**
- **Pure Methodology**: Experience the full power of professional troubleshooting frameworks
- **Complete Control**: Direct all analysis based on your expertise and knowledge
- **Privacy First**: No data leaves your device or goes to external services
- **Educational Value**: Learn the systematic approach through hands-on practice
- **Professional Development**: Build skills used in engineering, manufacturing, and scientific fields

#### **Manual Workflow Process**
1. **Complete Structured Analysis**: Fill in all IS/IS NOT dimensions thoroughly
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for patterns in your systematic boundary definitions
3. **Solution Development**: Generate solutions based on your structured findings
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Use diagnostic questioning to validate your theories
5. **Root Cause Identification**: Apply systematic thinking to identify underlying causes

The built-in examples demonstrate how the methodology works independently of AI, showing professional-grade analysis techniques.

## Tips & Best Practices

### **Effective Problem Definition**
- Focus on observable, measurable symptoms
- Avoid assumptions about causes
- Use specific, concrete language
- Separate symptoms from root causes

### **IS/IS NOT Analysis**
- Be thorough in documenting boundaries
- Look for patterns in what's excluded
- Consider similar situations without problems
- Use comparisons to narrow the scope

### **Working with AI Suggestions**
- Treat suggestions as starting points, not final answers
- Validate suggestions against your specific context
- Consider implementation feasibility
- Look for solutions that address root causes

### **Diagnostic Questions**
- Answer questions based on actual investigation
- Be honest about what you don't know
- Use questions to guide further data collection
- Document your findings for future reference
