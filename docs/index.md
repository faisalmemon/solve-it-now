## Problem-Solving Methodology

The app implements a systematic approach based on proven troubleshooting frameworks:

1. **Problem Definition** - Clearly state what's wrong with what object
2. **Specification Analysis** - Document WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, and EXTENT details
3. **AI Analysis** - Generate potential solutions and diagnostic questions
4. **Validation Process** - Evaluate suggestions and answer follow-up questions
5. **Solution Refinement** - Iterate until you find the root cause and solution
