</div>

This is the official documentation site for the **Solve It Now!** application available on Apple's App Store as a multi-platform app for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS.

## About the App

Solve It Now! is a systematic problem-solving application that guides users through proven professional troubleshooting methodologies. Built on frameworks used in manufacturing, engineering, and scientific research, the app provides structured tools for analyzing complex problems methodically. AI assistance is available to enhance your analysis, but the core value lies in the systematic approach itself.

## Problem-Solving Methodology

The app implements a systematic approach based on proven troubleshooting frameworks used in manufacturing, engineering, and scientific research. The methodology works with or without AI assistance:

1. **Problem Definition** - Clearly state what's wrong with what object using professional "Object/Defect" format
2. **Specification Analysis** - Document WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, and EXTENT details systematically
3. **IS/IS NOT Boundary Analysis** - Define problem boundaries to eliminate false leads and identify patterns
4. **Solution Development** - Generate solutions through structured analysis (optionally enhanced by AI)
5. **Validation Process** - Evaluate solutions and test hypotheses through guided investigation
6. **Root Cause Identification** - Iterate until you find the underlying cause and effective solution
