## Problem-Solving Methodology

The app implements a systematic approach based on proven troubleshooting frameworks used in manufacturing, engineering, and scientific research. The methodology works with or without AI assistance:

1. **Problem Definition** - Clearly state what's wrong with what object using professional "Object/Defect" format
2. **Specification Analysis** - Document WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, and EXTENT details systematically
3. **IS/IS NOT Boundary Analysis** - Define problem boundaries to eliminate false leads and identify patterns
4. **Solution Development** - Generate solutions through structured analysis (optionally enhanced by AI)
5. **Validation Process** - Evaluate solutions and test hypotheses through guided investigation
6. **Root Cause Identification** - Iterate until you find the underlying cause and effective solution
